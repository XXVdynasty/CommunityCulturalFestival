# Community Cultural Festival Management System

This C# Windows Forms application was developed as a final project for the COP3366E course at Florida A&M University. It allows organizers to manage participant data and event logistics for a community cultural festival that celebrates African and Caribbean traditions.

## Project Theme
This project is culturally responsive and inspired by African/Caribbean heritage — with participant categories like music, dance, art, and food. Historical figures such as Black Caesar and symbolic elements from the diaspora are subtly incorporated to reflect pride, legacy, and celebration.

## Features
- Register festival participants with name, category, contact info, and fees
- Categories include Music, Dance, Art, and Culinary
- View all participants and search by name or category
- Automatic fee total calculations
- Clean, interactive Windows Forms GUI
- Input validation and exception handling for user errors
- Uses object-oriented programming with custom classes

## Technologies
- C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2)
- Windows Forms (WinForms)
- Visual Studio 2022
- Git & GitHub for version control
